# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Prediction System using Machine Learning 
## Abstract
Crop prediction is a critical aspect of modern agriculture, leveraging advanced technologies and data analytics to forecast crop yields and optimize farming practices. This process involves the integration of various data sources, including historical crop performance, weather patterns, soil conditions, and satellite imagery. By employing machine learning algorithms and statistical models, crop prediction systems can analyze these data sets to identify trends and patterns that influence crop growth and productivity. The insights gained from these predictions enable farmers to make informed decisions on planting schedules, resource allocation, and pest management, ultimately enhancing crop yields and ensuring food security. As agricultural challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity continue to grow, the importance of accurate crop prediction in sustainable farming practices cannot be overstated.

##  About the Project
The **Crop Prediction System** uses real agricultural datasets to train and test multiple machine learning algorithms.  
By entering soil nutrient values (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, the system predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation.

The project also compares the accuracy of different ML algorithms and visualizes average crop requirements.

## Objectives of the Project
1) To predict the most lucrative crop to grow in a region and utilizing data analytics and
   machine learning to enhance crop predictions.
2) To test whether a particular crop can be grown in a region.
3) To visualize the nutritional requirements of soil and weather conditions for different crops.
   
##  Key Features
- Predicts optimal crop based on **7 parameters**:
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Phosphorus (P)
  - Potassium (K)
  - Temperature (Â°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - pH value
  - Rainfall (mm)

## Methedology of a Project
Dataset taken from the kaggle open source 
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset)
- **Description:** 22 crop types, 7 key soil & climate parameters.
In this project, I use **Five Different Machine Algorithms", To construct a machine learning model, an algorithm is performed on data for which the target variable is known. The modelâ€™s accuracy is determined by comparing the modelâ€™s outputs to the target variableâ€™s actual, observed values. And after fitting the best modelâ€™s performance is evaluated by accuracy and confusion matrices.

## Conclusion
â€¢	The comparative study of five different machine learning models (Random forest, Logistic regression, KNN classifier, Gaussian naÃ¯ve bayes and Decision tree) is done to predict the best-suited crop for the particular land that can help farmers to grow crops more efficiently.

â€¢	We concluded that the crop predicted dataset showed the best accuracy with Random Forest Classifier and Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier with 99.31% and 99.54% respectively.

â€¢	In contrast, Logistic Regression Classifier has the lowest accuracy among the five with 94.54%.

â€¢	When comparing the accuracy values, Random Forest Classifier gave a better accuracy of 99.31% contradicting with Gaussian naÃ¯ve bayes having accuracy with 99.54%.
